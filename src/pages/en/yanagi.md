Yanagi is the matron of knowledge and keeper of arcana. Worshiped by monks, scholars, and practitioners of the arcane, her temples are usually libraries or contained within schools or universities. Her goal is to conserve knowledge with the help of her followers and allow all to gain education if they so choose. 

## Commandments of Yanagi
* Study in order to increase your knowledge and improve yourself.
* Collect, catalog, and preserve information for all to access.
* Teach others with the wisdom you have acquired and stamp out ignorance in the world.
