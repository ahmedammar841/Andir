Tae is the god of love, fertility, and the underwriter of marriages. Almost all marriage ceremonies in Andir are officiated by a cleric of Tae. Tae is often worshiped by young people, couples hoping for children, and poets. 

## Commandments of Tae 
* Love and be loved in return.
* Have offspring and carry on your bloodline.
* Forgive and forget, grudges are truly a poison on the soul.
